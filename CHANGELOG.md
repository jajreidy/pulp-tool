## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Comprehensive type annotations for all function arguments
- Pre-commit hooks for code quality checks
- CHANGELOG.md following Keep a Changelog format
- CONTRIBUTING.md with development guidelines
- Developer scripts for common tasks
- Makefile with common development targets
- .editorconfig for consistent formatting

### Changed
- Renamed `transfer` command to `pull`; added `--transfer-dest` option for transfer destination. When using `--build-id` + `--namespace`, either `--transfer-dest` or group-level `--config` can be used
- Renamed file structure from `transfer` to `pull`: `cli/transfer.py` → `cli/pull.py`, `pulp_tool/transfer/` → `pulp_tool/pull/`, `TransferContext` → `PullContext`, `TransferService` → `PullService`, `tests/test_transfer.py` → `tests/test_pull.py`
- Upload progress messages (e.g. "Uploading SBOM: X", "Uploading RPM: X") now use logging.warning instead of info
- Consolidated all dependencies into pyproject.toml
- Improved type safety across the codebase
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Per-file upload progress: "Uploading X: filename" now logged at INFO so progress is visible at default verbosity
- README: Makefile-first development workflow, pre-commit, fixed typos and duplicate Create Repository section
- CONTRIBUTING: recommend `make install-dev`, pre-commit run twice, `make test` and 100% diff coverage for new code

### Removed
- `transfer` command (replaced by `pull`; use `pulp-tool pull` with `--transfer-dest` instead of `--config`)
- Documentation GitHub workflow (`.github/workflows/docs.yml`)
- Makefile targets: `docs`, `docs-clean`, `docs-serve`

### Fixed
- Fixed type annotation issues in transfer.py
- Fixed import order issues in cli.py
- Fixed Optional import missing in content_query.py
